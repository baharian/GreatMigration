identifying regional relatedness of African-Americans across the United States

Mathematica code to
  1. read, store, analyze, and visualize genetic relatedness of African-Americans and European-Americans across the United States
  2. read, store, model, and visualize relatedness of individuals across the United States based on the data from US Census Bureau
Results are available in the preprint article [The Great Migration and African-American genomic diversity](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/15/029173).

NOTE: I have removed the hard-coded paths to the data files from this project (for security reasons). So, this code, in its current state on GitHub, will not work! However, I shared it publicly to show the steps I took to solve the specific problems discussed in our publication.
